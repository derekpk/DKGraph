# DKGraph

This is a C++ project that was first written to run in Visual Studio and then converted to run in Eclipse.

The code is a graph with a twist, the edge stores the details about which vertex it's connected to and any weights and directions associated with that edge.

It has methods that will perform breath first and depth first searches from point A to B and the complete graph.
